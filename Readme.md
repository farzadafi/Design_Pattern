#### what is design pattern?

A design pattern is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design.
It is a general approach or a set of guidelines that can be applied to solve a particular design problem in a software
system.
Design patterns capture best practices and proven solutions that have evolved over time and have been found to be
effective in solving specific problems.

Design patterns provide a common vocabulary and a shared understanding among software developers, which can help improve
communication and collaboration.
They can also help improve the quality of software systems by making them more modular, maintainable, and extensible.
