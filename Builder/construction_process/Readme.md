### Construction Process Approach

the construction process must allow different representations for the
object that's constructed.

If the construction process does not allow for different representations of the object that's constructed, then the
resulting code may be inflexible and difficult to adapt to changing requirements or new use cases.

Using the Builder pattern, on the other hand, allows for different representations of the object to be constructed using
the same construction process. This means that different variations of the object can be created using different
builders, without having to modify the underlying construction algorithm. This makes the code more flexible and
adaptable to changing requirements or new use cases.
